This is a Docker on Windows Server 1803 Insider Vagrant environment for playing with Windows containers.

**THIS BRANCH WILL BE REBASED ON master FROM TIME TO TIME**

## Docker images

This environment builds and uses the following images:

# Usage

Install the [Base Windows Server Core Insider Box](https://github.com/rgl/windows-2016-vagrant).

Install the required plugins:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
```

Then launch the environment:

```bash
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox # or --provider=libvirt
```

At the end of the provision the [examples](examples/) are run.

The Docker Engine API endpoint is available at http://10.0.0.3:2375.

[Portainer](https://portainer.io/) is available at http://10.0.0.3:9000.

[Windows Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/overview) is available at https://10.0.0.3:8443.


# Graceful Container Shutdown

**Windows containers cannot be gracefully shutdown** because they are forcefully terminated after a while. Check the [moby issue 25982](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25982) for progress.

The next table describes whether a `docker stop --time 600 <container>` will graceful shutdown a container that is running a [console](https://github.com/rgl/graceful-terminating-console-application-windows/), [gui](https://github.com/rgl/graceful-terminating-gui-application-windows/), or [service](https://github.com/rgl/graceful-terminating-windows-service/) app.

| nanoserver        | gui     | fails to run because there is no GUI support in nano                                         |
| windowsservercore | gui     | **does not receive the shutdown notification**                                               |
| nanoserver        | service | receives the `SERVICE_CONTROL_PRESHUTDOWN` notification but is killed after about 10 seconds |

You can launch these example containers from host as:

```bash
vagrant execute -c '/vagrant/ps.ps1 examples/graceful-terminating-console-application/run.ps1'
vagrant execute -c '/vagrant/ps.ps1 examples/graceful-terminating-gui-application/run.ps1'
vagrant execute -c '/vagrant/ps.ps1 examples/graceful-terminating-windows-service/run.ps1'
```


# Troubleshoot

* Restart the docker daemon in debug mode and watch the logs:
  * set `"debug": true` inside the `$env:ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` file
  * restart docker with `Restart-Service docker`
  * watch the logs with `Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source docker -Newest 50`
* For more information see the [Microsoft Troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/troubleshooting) and the [CleanupContainerHostNetworking](https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/live/windows-server-container-tools/CleanupContainerHostNetworking) page.
